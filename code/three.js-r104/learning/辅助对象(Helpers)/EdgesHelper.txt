Creates a wireframe object that shows the "hard" edges of another object's geometry. To draw a full wireframe image of an object,
 see WireframeHelper.

代码示例：
	geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry( 10, 10, 10, 2, 2, 2 );
	material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial( { color: 0xff0000 } );
	object = new THREE.Mesh( geometry, material );

	edges = new THREE.EdgesHelper( object, 0x00ff00 );

	scene.add( object );
	scene.add( edges );

构造器（Constructor）
	EdgesHelper( object, color, thresholdAngle )
	object -- Object of which to draw edges 
	color -- Color of the edges.
	thresholdAngle -- the minimim angle (in degrees), between the face normals of 
		            adjacent faces, that is required to render an edge. Default is 0.1.

Creates a Line, showing only the "hard" edges of the passed object; specifically, no edge will be 
drawn between faces which are adjacent and coplanar (or nearly coplanar).
